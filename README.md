# 100 Days of ML Code
Challenge to do some ML exercise everyday for 100 days

## Day 1: July 6, 2018:
**Work done:** Today I started coding for a competiton on kaggle. I've finished the preprocessing and statistical analysis of data.<br>
**Thoughts:** I feel confident about today's work.<br>
**Link to competition website:** [Forest Cover Type - kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-kernels-only)<br>
**Proof of work:** File: "Analysis Forest Cover Type - commit 1"
<br><br>
## Day 1: July 7, 2018:
**Work done:** I have trained a KNN on the dataset.<br>
**Thoughts:** Training a model on data with high dimensions surely takes a lot of time.<br>
**Proof of work:** File: "Analysis Forest Cover Type - commit 2"
